>**Applied science** is the use of the scientific method and knowledge obtained via conclusions from the method to attain practical goals. It includes a broad range of disciplines such as engineering and medicine. Applied science is often contrasted with basic science, which is focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict natural or other phenomena.

# Summary of my knowledge/interest in Applied Science
The first few subcategories of Applied Science represent aspects of my career as a DoD public servant. But library and museum studies just happens to include Knowledge Management and Agriculture is probably the place that most of my (dog, cat, bird, fish, gardening) hobby information is included. Some #insight here is that fashion design is nested within Architecture and Design, within the over-arching Applied Science, separate from the Fabric Arts of the Humanities category.
