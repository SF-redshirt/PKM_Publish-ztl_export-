>**Humanities** are academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture, and also philosophy. In the Renaissance, the term contrasted with divinity and referred to what is now called classics, the main area of secular study in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as _any fields of study outside of natural sciences, social sciences, formal sciences and applied sciences_. They use methods that are primarily critical, or speculative, and have a significant historical element—as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences; yet, unlike the sciences, there is no general history of humanities as a distinct discipline in its own right.

Not Created: (See [0000 Outline of Academic Disciplines](0000%20Outline%20of%20Academic%20Disciplines.md) for complete list.) I only created notes for those that I have or need content in, so as not to create [[5331.004 Unearned Structure|unearned structure]].
- Visual Arts: Digital Art
- Visual Arts: Fashion - >Note: ⧗- [[2025-01-03]] 16:38:47 --  Considering whether this rates a category of its own.
- Visual Arts: Architecture
- History: Philosophical history
- History: Scientific history ==K [[2025-12-07]]: Low key, a little interested in this...==
- History: Technological history
- Theology: Buddhist theology (but for me Philosophy)

>Note: ⧗- [[2025-01-04]] 12:55:05 -- I created 1400 History today as a place to nest notes relating to historical facts and terms like [[1400.001 Luddites|Luddites]]. I did not see a need to further differentiate types of history, although if I start to build out a History and Systems of Psychology Course, I might need to.

> Note: ⧗- [[2025-12-07]] 14:07 -- Where is 1200? Did I not ever create that category? That would be weird. I might need to go back to an older Vault to see if it dropped for a good reason.
