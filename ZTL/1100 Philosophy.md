**Philosophy** is the processing of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language. Some sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras, although this theory is disputed by some. Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.

#definition  **Philosophy** (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): φιλοσοφία, _philosophia_, 'love of wisdom') is the processing of general and fundamental questions, such as those about [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence"), [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason"), [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), and [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language "Philosophy of language").

There is wide agreement that philosophy (from the [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") φίλος, phílos: "love"; and σοφία, sophía: "wisdom") is characterized by various general features: it is a form of [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational "Rational") inquiry, it aims to be systematic, and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods and presuppositions.
