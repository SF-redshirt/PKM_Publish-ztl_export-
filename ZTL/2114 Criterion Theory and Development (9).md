Criterion Theory and Development (9) (2114)

> Almost all applications of I-O psychology (e.g., selection, human resources planning, leadership, performance appraisal, organization design, organization diagnosis and development, training) involve measurements against criteria (standards) that indicate effectiveness and well-being of individuals, groups, and/or organizations, as well as inferences drawn from measures used to assess those entities. The selection of criteria is not a simple issue and represents a significant area of concern for I-O psychologists.

>The knowledge base of this domain incorporates understanding the theoretical issues such as single versus multiple criteria, criterion dynamics, the characteristics of good and acceptable criteria (relevance, reliability, practicality), and criteria as a basis for understanding human behavior at work and in organizations. Common criteria of interest include but are not limited to work performance including task and contextual performance, withdrawal (lateness, absenteeism, turnover), counterproductive behavior, and health and well-being.

> Beyond this knowledge, the I-O psychologist should have the skills necessary for developing valid criteria and methods of measuring them. These include skills in many of the other domains identified in the document (e.g., Job/Work Analysis, Research Methods).
