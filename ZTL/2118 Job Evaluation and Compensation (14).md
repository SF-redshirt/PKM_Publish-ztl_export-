Job Evaluation and Compensation (14) (2118)

>This competency area focuses on determining the appropriate compensation level for skills, tasks, and/or jobs. Job evaluation is a process by which the relative value of jobs is determined and then linked to commensurate compensation. It is closely tied to and usually predicated upon sound job/task/work analyses. In general, job evaluation and compensation involve identifying compensable factors, interpreting market data, attending to perceptions of fairness and equity, and considering issues of comparable worth. Proficiency in this competency area is demonstrated by a theoretical and applied understanding of various job-evaluation techniques, compensation strategies (e.g., pay for skills, team-based pay), benefits, and the legal and social issues surrounding compensation.
