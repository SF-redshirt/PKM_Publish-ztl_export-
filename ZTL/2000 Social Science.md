>[!Info]
>**Social science** is one of the branches of science, devoted to the study of societies and the relationships among individuals within those societies. The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original "science of society", established in the 19th century. In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, human geography, linguistics, management science, communication science and political science.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science)

# Summary of my knowledge/interest in Social Science
The three areas below are highly research-focused, and in many ways related to each other. I don't have much interest in Economics outside of its overlap (Econometrics) with Psychology (my chosen profession) -- and the fact that [[Jack Gunther|Jack]] is in Economics :). And all social science should have governance related to the protection of human subjects in research.
