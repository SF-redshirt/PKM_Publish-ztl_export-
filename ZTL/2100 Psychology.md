> [!NOTE]
> **Psychology** is the scientific study of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups. **Ψ** (_psi_), the first letter of the Greek word _psyche_ from which the term psychology is derived, is commonly associated with the science.
