Performance Appraisal/Management (21) (2112)
up:: [2110 Industrial-Organizational Psychology](2110%20Industrial-Organizational%20Psychology.md)
> Performance appraisal/management has both a knowledge and a skill base. This area (sometimes also referred to as Talent Management) centers on the methods of measuring and evaluating individuals as they perform organizational tasks, the influence of the social context in which they perform and are evaluated, and on taking action (administrative such as promotion/succession or rewards and/or developmental) with individuals on the basis of such appraisals.

> The knowledge base includes a thorough understanding of rating-scale construction and use and rater training. Also relevant are the areas of psychometric theory, measure development, data analysis, criterion theory and development, motivation theory, and the factors that underlie interpersonal perception, judgment, and evaluation (i.e., rating). An understanding of the similarities, differences, and inconsistencies among the perceptions and evaluations of performance and feedback provided by peers, customers, subordinates, and supervisors is essential.

> The skill base includes procedures for communicating performance evaluations to job incumbents and coaching them in appropriate means of improving their performance. Also, skill in designing a complete performance appraisal-/management–and-feedback system that meets organizational needs while maintaining and/or enhancing worker motivation and/or performance is required.
