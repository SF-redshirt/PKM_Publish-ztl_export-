> [!NOTE]
> **19. Organization Development**  
> This domain encompasses theory and research relevant to changing individuals, groups, and organizations to improve their [[2119.2 Organizational Effectiveness]]. This body of theory and research draws from such related fields as [2130 Social Psychology](2130%20Social%20Psychology.md), counseling psychology, educational psychology , vocational psychology, human factors, organizational behavior, and organizational theory.
> 
> Organization development concerns theory and research related but not limited to individual change strategies (e.g., [5131 Training and Development](5131%20Training%20and%20Development.md), socialization, [[attitude change]], career planning, counseling, and behavior modification), interpersonal and group change strategies (e.g., team building and group training, survey feedback, and conflict management), role- or task-oriented change strategies (e.g., job redesign, role analysis, management-by-objectives, and temporary task forces), and organization-system-directed change strategies (e.g., survey feedback, open–systems-oriented change programs, human-resource accounting, flexible work hours, structural changes, control-system changes, and quality circles). I-O psychologists should know how to diagnose problems and challenges in organizational settings and be able to design and evaluate the outcomes of organization development interventions (e.g., [[Program Evaluation]]).
