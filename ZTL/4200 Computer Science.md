# Summary of my knowledge/interest in Computer Science
Computing is a tool for the application of industrial/organizational psychology and educational psychology, where I have spent some portion of my career, and is also related to my interest in PKM. I had some [[insight]] that Knowledge Management showed up here and also in a different area of the OAD outline.
