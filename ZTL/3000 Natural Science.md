>[!Info]
>**Natural science** is one of the branches of science concerned with the description, understanding and prediction of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science)
# Summary of my knowledge/interest in Natural Science
This is mostly a hobby area for me, as a person who likes animals and finds them interesting. Apparently, I have a genetic predisposition to be a pet owner (with the trifecta of the most popular pets - dogs, cats, fish), according to Anscetry.com. 

>Note: ⧗- [[2024-04-07]] 12:25:32 -- to date, I don't have any Level 2 topic areas in this domain. I assume animal breeding (genetics), aquarium keeping, birdwatching, and dog training all fall in the Natural Science area. I think I've tended to place most of that content in [Applied Science](5000%20Applied%20Science.md), so it could be that I don't need this area at all!
