Ethics (1140)
>**Ethics** or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that "involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior". The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value; these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called axiology. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)

Reminds me of the contrasting [1112 Skepticism](1112%20Skepticism.md)

>Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") (469–399 BC) was one of the first [Greek philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy "Greek philosophy") to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [Self-knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-knowledge_(psychology) "Self-knowledge (psychology)") was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance.

The _**Nicomachean Ethics**_ is Aristotle's best-known work on ethics, the science of the good for human life, which is the goal or end at which all our actions aim. (I§2) The aim of the inquiry is political science and the master art of politics. (I§1) It consists of ten books or scrolls, understood to be based on notes from his lectures at the Lyceum. The title is often assumed to refer to his son Nicomachus, to whom the work was dedicated or who may have edited it. Alternatively, the work may have been dedicated to his father, who was also called Nicomachus. The work plays a pre-eminent role in explaining Aristotelian ethics.

>The [Stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism") philosopher [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus "Epictetus") posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or _[apatheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia "Apatheia")_, was of the highest [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics) "Value (ethics)"); self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The "unconquerable will" is central to this philosophy.
