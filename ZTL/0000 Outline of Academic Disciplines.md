>An [academic discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline") or [field of study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_study "Field of study") is a branch of [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"), [taught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education") and [researched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research") as part of [higher education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education "Higher education"). A scholar's discipline is commonly defined by the [university faculties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division) "Faculty (division)") and [learned societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_society "Learned society") to which they belong and the [academic journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal "Academic journal") in which they publish [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research").
>
>Disciplines vary between well-established ones that exist in almost all universities and have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences, and nascent ones supported by only a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, and these are often called sub-disciplines.
>
>The following [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list) "Outline (list)") is provided as an overview of and topical guide to academic disciplines. In each case an entry at the highest level of the hierarchy (e.g., Humanities) is a group of broadly similar disciplines; an entry at the next highest level (e.g., Music) is a discipline having some degree of autonomy and being the basic identity felt by its scholars; and lower levels of the hierarchy are sub-disciplines not normally having any role in the structure of the university's governance.

I use the OAD as the answer to the question [[5331.001 How should I organize my Personal Knowledge?]]

>Note: ⧗- [[2024-04-07]] 11:22:11 --  Currently I have 5 major areas in my [[5331 Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]]:
- [1000 Humanities](1000%20Humanities.md)
- [2000 Social Science](2000%20Social%20Science.md)
- [3000 Natural Science](3000%20Natural%20Science.md)
- [4000 Formal Science](4000%20Formal%20Science.md)
- [5000 Applied Science](5000%20Applied%20Science.md)
 Each of these has subcategories (up to 9, but in most cases, i have only 2-3 'Level 2' categories).
