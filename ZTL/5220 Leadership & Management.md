**Leadership**, both as a research area and as a practical skill, encompasses the ability of an individual, group or organization to "lead", influence or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The word "leadership" often gets viewed as a contested term. Specialist literature debates various viewpoints on the concept, sometimes contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also North American versus European approaches.

Leadership and Management (17) (2114) SIOP

> Management and leadership can be approached from different levels (e.g., teams, organizations, countries). The study of management and leadership at the macro level involves the influences that senior-level individuals have in the larger organizational context such as setting strategy, directing change, and influencing values. Theory and research may focus on characteristics of leaders, leader style, leader-member interactions, behaviors of leaders, and related phenomena. At a more-micro level, leadership and management involves the day-to-day exchange between formal and informal leaders and followers. This includes challenges faced by line managers in their relationships with subordinates in assigning tasks, evaluating performance, coaching and counseling for improvement, resource planning, and related tasks. Effective leadership and management involve task analysis, motivation, decision-making, career planning, selection, performance appraisal, interpersonal communication, listening, and related skills in a supervisor-subordinate context. Within this domain, it is important to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the various objective and subjective/perceptual measures of leadership effectiveness and emergence. Increasingly, attention is placed on team leadership and self-leadership (especially in relation to empowerment) and on horizontal leadership (i.e., peer-influence processes). (SIOP)
