> [!NOTE]
> The **performing arts** are arts such as music, dance, and drama which are performed for an audience. They are different from the visual arts, which are the use of paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience, including theatre, music, and dance. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts)
> 
> The **visual arts** are art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, photography, video, filmmaking, design, crafts and architecture. Many artistic disciplines such as performing arts, conceptual art, and textile arts also involve aspects of visual arts as well as arts of other types. Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design and decorative art. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts)

[1310 Fine Arts (Painting & Drawing)](1310%20Fine%20Arts%20%28Painting%20%26%20Drawing%29.md) - is technically in the Visual Arts main category 
[1320 Fashion & Textile Arts (Sewing)](1320%20Fashion%20%26%20Textile%20Arts%20%28Sewing%29.md) - Fashion is technically in the Visual Arts, and Textile is in Performing Arts, but these categories don't matter to me.
