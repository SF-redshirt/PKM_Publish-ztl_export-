### **Why 5115 Operations Management Works:**

1. **Broader Scope:**
    - Operations Management deals with managing ongoing organizational processes, aligning more closely with traditional management principles than with PMI-specific methodologies.
2. **Complementary to Operations Research:**
    - While Operations Research (nested in Systems Science) focuses on mathematical and analytical optimization of processes, Operations Management emphasizes the practical, managerial aspects of overseeing these processes.
3. **Logical Placement:**
    - Keeping **Operations Management** in **5115** under **Management** acknowledges its relevance as a core management function while maintaining its distinction from Systems Science and Operations Research.
