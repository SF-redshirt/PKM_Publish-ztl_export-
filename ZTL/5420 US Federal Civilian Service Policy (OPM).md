The **United States federal civil service** is the [civilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian "Civilian") workforce (i.e., non-elected and non-military [public sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector "Public sector") employees) of the [United States federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government "United States federal government")'s departments and agencies. The federal [civil service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service "Civil service") was established in 1871 ([5 U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_5_of_the_United_States_Code "Title 5 of the United States Code") [§ 2101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/2101)) U.S. state and local government entities often have comparable civil service systems that are modeled on the national system, in varying degrees.

The U.S. civil service is managed by the [Office of Personnel Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management "Office of Personnel Management"), which as of December 2011 reported approximately 2.79 million civil servants employed by the federal government, including employees in the departments and agencies run by any of the [three branches of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_the_United_States_government "Branches of the United States government") (the [executive branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States#Executive_branch "Federal government of the United States"), [legislative branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress "U.S. Congress"), and [judicial branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._federal_court "U.S. federal court")), including over 600,000 employees in the [U.S. Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service#Employment "United States Postal Service").
