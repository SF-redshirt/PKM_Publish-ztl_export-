# Summary of my knowledge/interest of Business
Of course, the areas here are alternative versions of the content area of industrial/organizational psychology. The question is whether or not these areas are unique/discrete enough to not overlap with what would appear in the Industrial/Organizational Psychology area of the PKM. I think the major differentiation is that much of the literature in this domain (from 'Business') is based on case studies, thought leaders, and theoretical. So I would say the major difference between what would show here from other areas would be 'evidence-basis'.
