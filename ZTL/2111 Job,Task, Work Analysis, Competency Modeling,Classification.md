Job & Task & Work Analysis & Competency Modeling and Classification (15) (2111)

[[USSF Competency Framework]]

> This domain encompasses the theory and techniques used to generate information about what is involved in performing a task, a job, or more broadly, work; the physical and social context of this performance; and the attributes needed by an incumbent for such performance. Tasks are basic units of activity, the elements of which highlight the connection between behavior and result. A job is a grouping of tasks designed to achieve an organizational objective. It is common for jobs to be grouped or classified on the basis of a variety of criteria, depending on the purpose and goals of the classification system. (SIOP)

The fundamental concern of job/task/work analysis and competency modeling is to obtain descriptive information to design training programs, establish performance criteria, develop selection systems, implement job-evaluation systems, redesign machinery or tools, and create career paths for personnel. The specific steps taken and the type of information gathered will vary depending on the purpose of the job/task/work analyses and on the classification system. Relevant information includes, but is not limited to: what worker behaviors are involved; the knowledge, skills, and abilities required; personality attributes relevant to targeted outcomes; the standards of performance desired; the tools, machines, and work aids used; the sources of information available to the incumbent; the social, environmental, and physical working conditions; and the nature of supervision. Similarly, some of the steps involved in job/task/work analyses include: identifying the purpose of the analysis; preparing, designing, or selecting a job-analysis system; collecting job/task/work information; summarizing the results; and documenting for future reference the steps taken. The classification of jobs typically entails identifying the purpose and goals of the classification system, designing a classification scheme, categorizing jobs according to the established scheme, and documenting the classification process and outcomes.

The individual who is competent in this domain should have knowledge of the different approaches to job/task/work analysis and classification, as well as skill in applying these techniques to real-world situations. This competency area is likely to continue to evolve as the nature of work in our society continues to change.
