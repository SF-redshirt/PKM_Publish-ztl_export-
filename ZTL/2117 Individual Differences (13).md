Individual Differences (13) (2117)

> I-O psychology emphasizes the role and measurement of individual differences in the study of work behavior. Because this emphasis requires accurate assessments of unobservable psychological traits, a sound background in both classical and modern measurement theories and their respective areas of application is essential. The domain of measurement includes theory and assessment of individual differences in skills, abilities, personality, motivation, and interests. This exposure would cover the nature of construct measurement and the philosophy-of-science assumptions underpinning many of our approaches to scale development. Other topics that might be covered are the measurement of attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction) by scaling procedures, the measurement of performance on complex jobs, and the measurement of comparable worth of individuals to organizations.

> A great deal of what I-O psychologists do in this area is subjected to close scrutiny by courts of law, civil-rights groups, and professional colleagues. Because of these external and internal pressures, students must be trained to conduct research and to apply measurement principles in conformity with the highest standards of our discipline. Students may also need skills to help communicate their research methods and findings to interested parties outside of the discipline.

> Although classical test theory offers an accessible introduction to key measurement principles, it is important to recognize alternative approaches to measurement. For example, questions about item and scale bias, test equating, minimum-competence assessments, mastery testing, tailored testing, and appropriateness raise issues that can be addressed by classical test theory, item response theory, and other solutions. Although psychometric applications were originally studied in relation to ability measurement, they have been generalized to other psychological constructs. Key topics in the arena of individual differences measurement include but are not limited to classical test theory, item response theory, psychometrics (reliability and validity), validation, scaling, and scale development.
