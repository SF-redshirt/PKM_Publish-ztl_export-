> **Buddhism** also known as **Buddha Dharma** and **Dharmavinaya** (transl. "doctrines and disciplines"), is an [Indian religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_religion "Indian religion") or [philosophical tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy#Buddhist_philosophy "Indian philosophy") based on [teachings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-sectarian_Buddhism "Pre-sectarian Buddhism") attributed to [the Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha "The Buddha"). It originated in present-day [North India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India "North India") as a _[śramaṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a "Śramaṇa")_–movement in the 5th century BCE, and [gradually spread throughout much of Asia via the Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_transmission_of_Buddhism "Silk Road transmission of Buddhism"). It is the [world's fourth-largest religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups "Major religious groups"), with over 520 million followers (**Buddhists**) who comprise seven percent of the global population.

I took a course in college on Eastern Philosophy, and that surveyed Buddhism. Part of the class was learning about and practicing meditation. Between this, and living in Japan, with some exposure to [[1121.101 Zen Buddhism]], that philosophy has influenced my worldview. I've always been struck by the numerous parallels between [1111 Stoicism](1111%20Stoicism.md) and Buddhism.
