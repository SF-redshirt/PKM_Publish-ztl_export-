>[!info]
>A **formal science** is a branch of science studying disciplines concerned with abstract structures described by formal systems, such as logic, mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, information theory, game theory, systems theory, decision theory, and theoretical linguistics. Whereas the natural sciences and social sciences seek to characterize physical systems and social systems, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences use language tools concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by formal systems. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures used to describe the physical world, and what inferences may be made about them.

# Summary of my knowledge/interest in Formal Science
I find it interesting that I have as many levels of topics in this area as I do, because I'm not sure that I consider myself particularly adept in this area. But my work requires it, and as I grow older, I am ever more fascinated with math and computers. Of course statistics underlies most of what I do, even when I'm not actively engaged in 'doing statistics' at this phase of my life.
