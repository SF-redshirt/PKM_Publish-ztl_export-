> [!NOTE]
> **Fashion** is a form of self-expression with a specific context, such as time, place and purpose. Example of these are clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is _trending_. Everything that is considered _fashion_ is available and popularized by the fashion system.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion)
> 
> **Textile arts** are arts and crafts that use plant, animal, or synthetic fibers to construct practical or decorative objects. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_arts)

>Note: ⧗- 2023/06/18 12:47:36 -- I thought it was interesting that Textile Art falls under Performing Arts not Visual Arts... I'm grouping Fashion (Visual Art) and Textile (Performing Art) together, since they are grouped in my head anyway.
