> [!NOTE]
> **Stoicism** is a school of [Hellenistic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy "Hellenistic philosophy") founded by [Zeno of Citium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium") in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") in the early 3rd century [BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era"). It is a philosophy of personal [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics "Virtue ethics") informed by its system of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and its views on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve [_eudaimonia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia "Eudaimonia") (happiness, lit. 'good spiritedness'): one flourishes by living an [ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") life. The Stoics identified the path to _eudaimonia_ with a life spent practicing [virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue "Virtue") and living in accordance with nature.
> 
> Alongside [Aristotelian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_ethics "Aristotelian ethics"), the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics "Virtue ethics").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-1) The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and that external things, such as health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves (_[adiaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiaphora "Adiaphora")_) but have value as "material for virtue to act upon". Many Stoics—such as [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger "Seneca the Younger") and [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus "Epictetus")—emphasized that because "virtue is sufficient for [happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_happiness "Philosophy of happiness")", a [sage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(philosophy) "Sage (philosophy)") would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called _[prohairesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohairesis "Prohairesis")_) that is "in accordance with [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(philosophy) "Nature (philosophy)")". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-2) To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they believed everything was rooted in nature.

> Stoicism flourished throughout the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") and [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Greece "Roman Greece") world until the 3rd century CE, and among its adherents was Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] became the state religion in the 4th century CE. Since then, it has seen revivals, notably in the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_philosophy "Renaissance philosophy") ([Neostoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neostoicism "Neostoicism")) and in the contemporary era ([modern Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Stoicism "Modern Stoicism")).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-3)
