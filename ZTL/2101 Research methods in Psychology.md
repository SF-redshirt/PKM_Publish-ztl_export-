## Notes:
"It has been suggested that science has three goals: description, prediction, and explanation." (Muchinsky, 2012, p. 26)

Empirical Research Process
- evidence-based - see also [[Evidence-Based Management]]
- from observation (perception)
- from experiments

The Empirical Research Cycle
- statement of the problem
- design of research study
- measurement of variables
- analysis of data
- conclusion from research
- (which feeds new statements of the problem)

"Charlie Chan thinks that researchers become too committed to proving their theories and become blinded to information that doesn't conform to the theory they want to believe." (p. 28)

"Campbell (1990) believes that theories are only a means to an end and thus have no inherent value." (p. 28)
