A **budget** is a [calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation") plan, usually but not always [financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_plan "Financial plan"), for a defined [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_period "Accounting period"), often one year or a month. A budget may include anticipated [sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales "Sales") volumes and [revenues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue "Revenue"), resource quantities including time, [costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost "Cost") and [expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense "Expense"), environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, other impacts, [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset "Asset"), [liabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting) "Liability (financial accounting)") and [cash flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow "Cash flow"). Companies, governments, families, and other organizations use budgets to express [strategic plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning "Strategic planning") of activities in measurable terms.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget#cite_note-CIMA-1)

A budget expresses intended expenditures along with proposals for how to meet them with resources. A budget may express a [surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget "Balanced budget"), providing resources for use at a [future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future "Future") time, or a deficit in which expenditures exceed [income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income "Income") or other resources.

[[0000.0001 Outline of Academic Disciplines|OAD]] did not give direct reference to Budgeting, but I looked at Public Administration, and found reference to it on that wiki.
