**Space warfare** is hypothetical combat in which one or more belligerents are situated in outer space. The scope of space warfare therefore includes _ground-to-space warfare_, such as attacking satellites from the Earth; _space-to-space warfare_, such as satellites attacking satellites; and _space-to-ground warfare_, such as satellites attacking Earth-based targets. Space warfare in fiction is thus sub-genre and theme of science fiction, where it is portrayed with a range of realism and plausibility.
